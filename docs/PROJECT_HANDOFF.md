# Leet9 Project Handoff

A closeout checkpoint for anyone taking over the Leet9 web MVP. The app is a
modular, mock-backed product shell; no real platform sync or persistent product
data exists yet.

## Repo

- **Repo:** `Leet9-Dev/landing.v1`
- **Local path:** `~/Desktop/landing.v1`
- **Latest main:** `b3dd00b feat: prepare platform integration architecture (#11)`
- **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, NextAuth (Google +
  Steam), Prisma + Postgres (Neon) for auth persistence only. JavaScript
  (`.js/.jsx`), inline styles.

## Merged phases

| Phase | Title | PR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | App Shell (auth shell, `/app`, sidebar, topbar, nav) | #4 |
| 2 | Discovery Vertical Slice | #6 |
| 3 | Profile Vertical Slice (Overview + Games) | #7 |
| 4 | Rankings Vertical Slice (Players, Games, Tribes) | #8 |
| 5 | Profile Stats Vertical Slice | #9 |
| 6 | Lightweight Tribe Vertical Slice | #10 |
| 7 | Platform Integration Readiness | #11 |

The product triangle — **Discovery** (what games exist in the community),
**Profile** (who I am as a gamer), **Rankings** (how I compare) — is complete and
mock-backed end to end, plus a lightweight Tribe community layer and
platform-integration readiness for Steam + PSN.

## Product routes

- `/` — landing page (ENTER → Google / Steam login)
- `/dashboard` — redirects to `/app`
- `/app` — protected; redirects to `/app/discovery`
- `/app/discovery` — Discovery grid (search, platform filter, sort, sections)
- `/app/discovery/[gameId]` — Game Deep Dive (+ Add to Profile mock action)
- `/app/profile` — tabbed: **Overview**, **Games**, **Stats**, **Tribe**
  (Overview includes a read-only Platform Sources section)
- `/app/rankings` — tabbed: **Players**, **Games**, **Tribes**

All `/app/*` routes are protected by the session guard in `app/app/layout.js`.

## API routes (all mock-backed)

Auth
- `…/api/auth/[...nextauth]` — NextAuth (Google + Steam)

Discovery / Games
- `GET /api/discovery/games` — catalogue; source badges derived from external sources
- `GET /api/games/[gameId]` — game detail + external sources + current user game
- `POST /api/me/games/[gameId]/add` — add to profile (mock)

Current user / Profile
- `GET /api/me` · `GET /api/me/profile` · `GET /api/me/games` ·
  `GET /api/me/activity` · `GET /api/me/stats`

Rankings
- `GET /api/rankings/players` · `GET /api/rankings/games` · `GET /api/rankings/tribes`

Tribe
- `GET /api/me/tribe` · `GET /api/tribes/[tribeId]` · `GET /api/tribes/[tribeId]/members`

Platforms (Phase 7)
- `GET /api/platforms` — **public** provider metadata + capabilities
- `GET /api/me/platform-accounts` — current user's Steam/PSN states
- `GET /api/platforms/detected-games` — normalized detections + canonical mapping

All `/api/me/*`, `/api/rankings/*`, `/api/tribes/*`, and
`/api/platforms/detected-games` require a session (return
`UNAUTHENTICATED` / HTTP 401 when signed out). `/api/discovery/*`,
`/api/games/*`, and `/api/platforms` are currently public. Responses use the
`{ ok, data, meta }` envelope from `lib/api/response.js`.

## Mock-backed areas

Everything below is mock data in `lib/mock/*.js`, joined to canonical games by
`gameId` (canonical game data is never duplicated):

- `currentUser`, `platformAccounts`, `platformDetectedGames`
- `games`, `gameExternalSources`, `userGames`
- `profile` (signature games, friends), `activity`, `achievements`, `statsSummary`
- `rankings` (players), `tribes` (tribe rankings), `tribe` (detail + members)

Platform contracts live in `lib/platforms/` (`platforms.js`,
`normalization.js`, `canonicalMatching.js`).

## Important docs

- `docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md` — area-by-area manual QA backlog (deferred; owner: Mattia)
- `docs/PLATFORM_INTEGRATION_READINESS.md` — platform-agnostic architecture, the
  normalized ingestion flow, canonical matching, and future integration steps

## Important product rule

**Leet9 is platform-agnostic. Steam and PSN are first-class game-data sources.**
Raw platform data must be normalized into Leet9-owned models before powering
Discovery, Profile, Stats, Rankings, or future Competitions. The required flow:

```
Connected Platform Account
  → Raw Detected Platform Game
  → Normalized Detected Game
  → GameExternalSource (platform externalId → canonical gameId)
  → Canonical Game
  → UserGame
  → Discovery / Profile / Stats / Rankings
```

Steam and PSN versions of the same title map to **one** canonical Game and appear
**once** in Discovery with badges for every detected platform.

## Deferred QA (owner: Mattia)

Manual QA is intentionally deferred and must be completed before any public
release or real-data integration. See `docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md`. Outstanding:

- Signed-in full browser QA across all tabs and the core product loop
  (login → Discovery → Game Deep Dive → Add to Profile → Profile Games → Rankings)
- Mobile / responsive pass
- Vercel production smoke test
- Steam real login (if not configured) and cross-browser pass
- Accessibility pass
- Confirm every protected endpoint returns 401 when signed out

## Not built yet

- Real Steam sync
- Real PSN sync
- Real database-backed product data (only NextAuth persistence exists)
- Competitions / competition scoring
- Rewards / marketplace
- Wallet / blockchain / NFT
- Game downloads
- Real tribe management (create / invite / leave / kick / promote / settings)

## Recommended next phase

**Phase 8 — Contract & Data Model Alignment.**

**Why next:** the platform status vocabulary must be aligned before real
Steam/PSN integration. Phase 7 introduced normalized account statuses
(`connected` / `disconnected` / `needs_reauth` / `unavailable`) in
`lib/platforms/platforms.js`, while the original `API_CONTRACT.md` /
`DATA_MODEL.md` use an older set (`not_connected` / `expired` / `sync_failed` /
`revoked`). These should be reconciled — along with the rest of the API/data-model
contract — so the data shapes are stable before persistence and sync are built on
top of them.

## Suggested next commands (for Mattia)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Validation status at handoff

`npm run lint` → 0 errors (5 pre-existing warnings). `npm run build` → succeeds,
all routes registered. No `.env`, OAuth, Vercel, or Neon settings were changed
across any phase; no secrets are committed.
